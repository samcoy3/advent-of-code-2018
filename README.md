# advent-of-code-2018

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018), written in Clojure.

## Instructions

Just run `lein run`, and a table with the solutions completed so far should be output.

## TODO

Small list of things to tidy up here:

- Clean up solution to 3A.
- Make 5 run a little faster, maybe by using `pmap`.
- Make 11B run a little faster.
- Make 12B detect end of problem automatically.
- Reduce code duplication in 13.
